                    <p>Hello! My name is Devin Seay and I am Physics Ph.D. student specializing in theoretical and experimental nuclear physics. 
                        My primary research focuses on the spin distribution of hadrons through the study of the Sivers Distribution of polarized proton targets. 
                        Much of my work consists of applications of Machine Learning and AI in experimental instrumentation and theoretical prediction and analysis.
                        Outside of physics, I am a big film fanatic, a bookworm, a traveler, a powerlifter, and a novice cook! </p>
                    <p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Virginia and am currently pursuing my PhD there as well under the advisorship of Professor Dustin Keller.</p>
